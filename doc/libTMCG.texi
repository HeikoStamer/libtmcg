@chapter Introduction
`@acronym{LibTMCG}' is a free general purpose C++ library for
creating secure electronic card games. The most remarkable
feature is the absence of a trusted third party (TTP), i.e.
neither a central game server nor similar facilities. To emphasize
this again: With LibTMCG there is no need for an independent
referee, because the applied protocols provide a basic level
of confidentiality and fairness by itself. Of course, we
cannot avoid that malicious players share information about
their private cards, but the protocols ensure that the
shuffle of the deck is performed randomly (provided that
at least one player is honest) and thus the cards will be
distributed uniformly among the players. Further, no coalition
can learn the private cards of a player agains his
will (except for trivial conclusions). The corresponding
cryptographic problem, actually called ''Mental Poker'',
has been studied since 1979 (Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman)
by many authors. Reference is made at this point to 
@cite{TODO} for a brief introduction.

Our implementation relies on advanced cryptographic
techniques---the so-called zero-knowledge proofs. Using
these building blocks the high-level protocols minimize
the effect of coalitions and preserve the confidentiality
of the players' strategy, i.e. the players are not required
to reveal their cards at the end of the game to show that
they did not cheat.

@section Getting Started

This manual documents the library application programming
interface (API) of LibTMCG. All important classes and security
parameters are explained. The reader should have an advanced
knowledge in applied cryptography and C++ programming.
