/** @brief Data structure for cards.
    
    This struct represents a card in the original encoding scheme of
    Schindelhauer [Sch98]. The type of the card is shared among the
    players by the usage of quadratic residues resp. non-residues.
    Thus the security relies on the well known Quadratic Residuosity
    Assumption (QRA). */

	    representation of the card type there is a column. The elements
