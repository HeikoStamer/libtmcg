/** @brief Data structure for secrets of the masking operation.

    discrete logarithm instantiation of the general cryptographic
    primitive "Verifiable-k-out-of-k Threshold Masking Function" by
    Barnett and Smart [BS03]. */

	    It should be chosen uniformly and randomly from @f$\mathbb{Z}_q@f$
	    where @f$q@f$ is the order of the finite abelian group @f$G@f$ for
	    which the DDH assumption holds.
	
	    According to the results of Koshiba and Kurosawa [KK04] the length
	    of @f$r@f$ can be shorten to a reasonable value (e.g. 160 bit).
	    Under the additional DLSE assumption the necessary DDH problem in
	    @f$G@f$ seems to be still hard enough. Thus we can gain a great
	    performance advantage by using such short exponents. */
