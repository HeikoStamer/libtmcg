.SH NAME
dkg\-generate \- distributed key generation for OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-generate
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program performs the t-resilient distributed key generation protocol for
discrete logarithm based cryptosystems as described by Gennaro et al.
It employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages between the participants.
Thus a working GNUnet peer is neccesary to proceed. 
.br
For each party an individual DSA signing key is generated which is the OpenPGP
primary key. The shared ElGamal key for encryption is arranged as subkey. Thus
each party should verify after key generation, that the published public key
of the group contains this shared ElGamal key. The program generates three
different files: First, a file with the extension .dkg which contains the
internal state of the DKG protocol including some verification keys for
threshold decryption (see dkg\-decrypt(1)), second, a file that stores the
individual private key in ASCII-armored OpenPGP format, and finally, a file
that contains the individual public key. All file names have the GNUnet peer
identity of the participating party as common prefix.
.br
The parameter t determines how many parties may deviate from the protocol
during the key generation and later during threshold decryption. At least
t+1 participants are needed to recover or to decrypt a OpenPGP message.
This parameter can be adjusted by using the option "-t". The default value
is (n-1)/2 where n is the number of participants. Since 0-resilience and
other deviations are not desireable, the program ensures that 0 < t <= n holds. 
.br
The underlying DDH-hard group, i.e. a prime order subgroup of special form,
can be adjusted by using the option "-g". The included program dkg\-gencrs
generates a different corresponding common reference string on that all 
participants must agree. The generated group parameters are verifiable up
to a certain level. However, it is recommended that this crucial part is
accomplished by some trusted members or all participants together.
