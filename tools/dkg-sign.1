.SH NAME
dkg\-sign \- threshold signature scheme for OpenPGP (only DSA/DSS)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-decrypt
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates a detached signature for a given file, where the
private DSA key has been shared between multiple parties by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
For successful signature at least 2s+1 different participants must join
the protocol and provide their corresponding shares. The threshold parameter s
has been fixed during distributed key generation and cannot changed at
this stage of processing.
.PP
Currently, only DSA/DSS is supported as signature algorithm. The program
needs the corresponding privat key file as generated by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
.PP
The program employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages, where PEERS
must be a sufficient subset (i.e. at least 2s+1) of the GNUnet peer identities
used during distributed key generation with
.BR dkg\-generate (1)
including the calling peer.

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT
be used in production environments.

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Security vulnerabilities or cryptographic complaints should be reported
via an email directly to

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command creates a detached signature of the file foo.txt with three participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities.
The signature in armored OpenPGP format is written to foo.txt.asc and can be verified by any OpenPGP implementation.
.PP
.nf
.RS
dkg-decrypt -i foo.txt -o foo.txt.asc -w 10 3PT18Z2345NA6FM86BKVJ32DK88KXF0YWKTDPPQX1QJMBPEF4530 S41SNHFSGVR3A88ZPX3ZB3BKD2EN0Z29VEKKS1BMVMQNMWSRG3N0 WS3KHEYKKF6QQ6NDQKKCJ2B374RSSXJ05TB5D9W9FYKPPEJ3QKFG
.RE
.fi
.PP
At least 2s+1 parties must run such a process on the same input file. The program waits ten minutes before the threshold signature
protocol is started, because establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take some time.
