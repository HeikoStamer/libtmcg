.TH DKG\-REVOKE "1" "July 2017" "LibTMCG 1.3.2" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
dkg\-revoke \- threshold revocation protocol for OpenPGP (only DSA/DSS)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-revoke
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program revokes an OpenPGP primary key and the corresponding subkey,
where the private DSA key has been shared between multiple parties by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
For a successful revocation at least 2s+1 different participants must join
the protocol and provide their corresponding signature shares. The threshold
parameter s has been fixed during distributed key generation and cannot
changed at this stage of processing. The program needs the corresponding
privat key file as generated by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
The results, i.e., the key revocation signatures, are written to the public
key file in ASCII-armored OpenPGP format.
.PP
The program employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages, where PEERS
must be a sufficient subset (i.e. at least 2s+1) of the GNUnet peer identities
used during distributed key generation with
.BR dkg\-generate (1)
including the calling peer.
.PP
By the additional option "-r" the callers can specify a reason for revocation
(machine-readable code) as defined by RFC 4880:
.RS 4
\fB 0\fR No reason specified
\fB 1\fR Key is superseded
\fB 2\fR Key material has been compromised
\fB 3\fR Key is retired and no longer used
.RE
The default value is zero (no reason specified).

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT
be used in production environments.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command revokes the shared keys with three participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities. The signature in armored OpenPGP format is written to foo.txt.asc and can be verified by any OpenPGP implementation.
.PP
.nf
.RS
dkg-revoke -r 1 -w 10 3PT18Z2345NA6FM86BKVJ32DK88KXF0YWKTDPPQX1QJMBPEF4530 S41SNHFSGVR3A88ZPX3ZB3BKD2EN0Z29VEKKS1BMVMQNMWSRG3N0 WS3KHEYKKF6QQ6NDQKKCJ2B374RSSXJ05TB5D9W9FYKPPEJ3QKFG
.RE
.fi
.PP
At least 2s+1 parties must run such a process with the same revocation reason (key is superseded). The program waits ten minutes before the revocation protocol is started, because establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take some time.
