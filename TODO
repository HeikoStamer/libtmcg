* add abstraction layer for cryptographic primitives (i.e. libgcrypt calls) 
* add a generic group abstraction layer, e.g. for future use of ECC groups
* add a constant-time implementation for modular multiplication mpz_smulm()
* add generic broadcast channel abstraction layer, e.g. AbstractBroadcastChannel
* RBC: stabilize behaviour of deliver() by asynchronous IO of C++14/17 

+ provide interactive and distributed (multiparty DZKP) versions for
  bootstrapping non-interactive protocols of VTMF, i.e., key generation
  (for applications that cannot rely on the random oracle assumption or
   the h-generation protocol as building block of ASTC [JL00])
+ VTMF: add interactive versions of Chaum-Pedersen PoK of dlog equality
+ DZKP also called "Simultaneous Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge" [JL00]
+ DKG, ASTC: transform protocols into variants without aiou->Send() [BH92]
+ move to event-driven architecture and state-based protocol representation
+ provide a byzantine consensus protocol for agreement on values
+ implement asynchronous VSS [CKLS02] for DKG and other applications

- deterministic DSA for ASTC/DSS: cf. RFC 6979; maybe it's impossible for TC
- implement the exotic card and stack operations of the toolbox; there are
  some obstacles, e.g. that the prover does not know all used randomizers,
  for the subset and superset protocols; general protocols for private set
  operations (PSI) are also not useful, because they do not provide the link
  from the shuffled deck to individual set operations on private cards
