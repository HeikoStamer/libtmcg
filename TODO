* doc: advise users to call SetupGenerators() in VSSHE

+ provide DKG with security against an adaptive adversary [CGJKR99]
+ provide distributed DSS key generation and signature scheme [GJKR01]
+ DKG, ASTC: transform protocols into variants without aiou->Send() [BH92]
+ provide byzantine consensus protocol
+ provide interactive versions for the non-interactive protocols of VTMF
  (for applications that cannot rely on the random oracle assumption)

- implement the exotic card and stack operations of the toolbox; there are
  some obstacles, e.g. that the prover does not know all used randomizers,
  for the subset and superset protocols; general protocols for private
  set operations are also not useful, because they do not provide the link
  from the shuffled deck to individual set operations
