1. see TODO header of GrothVSSHE.cc
2. improve the membership test operation in BarnettSmartVTMF_dlog.cc
   (precompute a exponentiation table for the fixed value of $q$)

- implement more card and stack operations of the toolbox
- generalize the usage of the VTMF primitive (more general base class)
- use local namespaces TMCG and VMTF to prevent pollution
- documentation: doxygen? and examples
- The library should provide a protocol for reliable broadcast
  to ensure that rogue tracing can be performed.
