* provide simple Bracha RBC
+ provide interactive versions for the non-interactive protocols of VTMF
  (for applications that cannot rely on the random oracle assumption)

- implement the exotic card and stack operations of the toolbox; there are

  from the shuffled deck to individual set operations
