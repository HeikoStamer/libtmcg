+ set TMCG_MPZ_IO_BASE to 62, which is supported by libgmp >= 4.2
  (However, this breaks all backward compatibility and we gain not much.)
+ provide interactive versions for the non-interactive protocols of VTMF
+ implement public-coin version of VRHE to get rid of honest verifiers

- implement the exotic card and stack operations of the toolbox; there are
  some obstacles, e.g. that the prover does not know all used randomizers
