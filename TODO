+ set TMCG_MPZ_IO_BASE to 62, which is supported by libgmp >= 4.2
  (However, this breaks all backward compatibility and we gain not much.)
+ see TODO header of GrothVSSHE.cc; however, there are some theoretical
  results that show the insecurity of Fiat-Shamir heuristic w.r.t. soundness,
  because with public hash functions the random oracle model does not hold and
  a malicious prover can cheat by manipulating the pseudo-random challenges

- implement the exotic card and stack operations of the toolbox; there are
  some obstacles, e.g. that the prover does not know all used randomizers
- cheater detection: provide a basic protocol for reliable/atomic broadcast
