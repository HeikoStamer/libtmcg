1.0.1 A weakness in TMCG_CreateStackSecret() was corrected which may lead
      to a biased shuffle in some circumstances. Note that SecureSkat is
      not affected by this issue. Furthermore, the documentation has been
      improved and the function version_libTMCG() was added.
1.0.0 Groth's HVZK shuffle argument provides a major improvement in terms of
      reduced communication and computational complexity.
