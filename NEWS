1.3.3
1.3.2 Major improvements for distributed key generation (DKG) and threshold
      cryptography have been added. For example, the robust DSA compatible
      threshold signature scheme of Canetti et al. is now included. LibTMCG
      contains an implementation of these protocols that provides threshold
      decryption and signatures for OpenPGP (RFC 4880). However, such schemes
      are of independent interest and can be used for distributed electronic
      card games (e.g. drop-out tolerance) as well. Finally some bugfixes
      improve the robustness of the reliable broadcast protocol (RBC).
1.3.1 Small enhancements have been added. In particular, the class VSSHE now
      provides a simple variant of the SetupGenerators_publiccoin(). 
1.3.0 This is mainly a bugfix release that removes some issues found by
      coverity scan. However, there are also some new undocumented protocols
      and experimental support for distributed key generation has been added.
      The most important change is a verifiable setup of VTMF group generator.
      For some advanced protocols (e.g. Groth's shuffle) with more than two
      parties the distributed coin flipping protocol (EDCF) should be used.
1.2.0 The default security parameters have been updated to current state of
      the art. The complexity of hash function g() was improved. Unfortunately,
      this breaks compatibility with instances that have been compiled with
      older versions of LibTMCG. 
      The configure switch --with-gmp has been added in order to find the
      required libgmp on a non-standard path (e.g. on MacOS). Non-interactive
      versions of the verifiable shuffle resp. rotation protocol provide more
      efficient instantiations with soundness based on the well-known 
      Fiat-Shamir heuristic. The interactive versions of the protocols have
      been strengthened against malicious verifiers by coin flipping between
      prover and verifier. Finally a protocol for reliable broadcast is now
      included. Last but not least, the documentation has been improved.
1.1.3 The VRHE scheme provides an efficient HVZK argument for cyclic shuffle.
1.1.2 Small bugfixes have been applied in order to compile with gcc 4.3.x.
1.1.1 A major security bug (missing range check) was fixed, which allows an
      adversary to choose trivial group generators. This flaw has a crucial
      impact on the confidentiality of private cards. Thus, we strongly
      recommend all users to update LibTMCG as soon as possible.
1.1.0 Some interfaces were changed to allow the creation of keys without
      included non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of validity. In
      particular, this is more convenient whenever the new VTMF encoding
      scheme is used. Further some optimizations have been applied.
1.0.1 A weakness in TMCG_CreateStackSecret() was corrected which may lead
      to a biased shuffle in some circumstances. Note that SecureSkat is
      not affected by this issue. Furthermore, the documentation has been
      improved and the function version_libTMCG() was added.
1.0.0 Groth's HVZK shuffle argument provides a major improvement in terms
      of reduced communication and computational complexity.
