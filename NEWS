1.1.2

1.1.1 A major security bug (missing range check) was fixed, which allows an
      adversary to choose trivial group generators. This flaw has a crucial
      impact on the confidentiality of private cards. Thus, we strongly
      recommend all users to update LibTMCG as soon as possible.
1.1.0 Some interfaces were changed to allow the creation of keys without
      included non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of validity. In
      particular, this is more convenient whenever the new VTMF encoding
      scheme is used. Further some optimizations have been applied.
1.0.1 A weakness in TMCG_CreateStackSecret() was corrected which may lead
      to a biased shuffle in some circumstances. Note that SecureSkat is
      not affected by this issue. Furthermore, the documentation has been
      improved and the function version_libTMCG() was added.
1.0.0 Groth's HVZK shuffle argument provides a major improvement in terms
      of reduced communication and computational complexity.
